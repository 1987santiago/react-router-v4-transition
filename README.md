# React Router Transition
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/aboeglin/react-router-v4-transition.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/aboeglin/react-router-v4-transition) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/aboeglin/react-router-v4-transition/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/aboeglin/react-router-v4-transition?branch=master)

Transitions for React Router v4. The API is composed of two components that will allow the Switch
component from react-router v4 to switch from a route to another one with a transition.

In the next update: 
- do some testing
- add warnings for uses that aren't allowed by the API.
- add an example app showcasing the API.
