# React Router Transition

Transitions for React Router v4. The API is composed of two components that will allow the Switch
component from react-router v4 to switch from a route to another one with a transition.

In the next update: 
- do some testing
- add warnings for uses that aren't allowed by the API.
- add an example app showcasing the API.
